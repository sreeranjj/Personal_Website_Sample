I am currently a graduate student pursuing an MS in Robotics from the Georgia Insitute of Technology. Prior to this I was working as a software engineer at MathWorks, Bangalore office in the Robotics and Autonomous Driving division. I hold a bachelor's and master's degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. 

I have been intrigued by Robotics and Controls right from my undergraduate.  I feel robotics engineers are building a significant aspect of the future that is at the forefront of everyoneâ€™s mind and that to me is incredibly exciting.  Specifically, my interests include autonomous vehicles, flight vehicle controls, nonlinear systems, and the development of scenario simulation workflows.
